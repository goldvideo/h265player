# Introduction

With the development of video encoding technology, compared with H.264, H.265 has only half the volume of the same picture quality, half of the bandwidth consumption, and more detailed picture quality. However, the web browser does not support the decoding  of H.265. so we make the project based on Web Assembly (from FFmpeg), JS demux, paint by Canvas and AudioContext to achieve H265 play on the web browsers.

## 
Supported browsers:
Chrome（>57）
Safari (>11)
Firefox (>52)

This project is a publicly basic version and does not contain business logic codes. Business can be based on this project for specific business realization.

```

## Contruction
```shell
# choose one to build

```

## Nginx configuration(Or other Server)

```javascript
server {
    listen       8000;
    location / {
        root   <path of goldvideo>/goldvideo;
        index  index.html index.htm;
        autoindex on;
    }
}
```

## Run test
restart nginx server and visit demo page, you can see the player.
[http://localhost:8000/h265player/demo/demo.html](http://localhost:8000/h265player/demo/demo.html)
if you have seen the player. congratulations! 
if you can't play the video, you need to check the source path and the error of control bar. please feedback the problem the you have met, we'll  respond to you quickly.

    More details, then go down.

# NPM quick install. [optional]

```shell
# you can using npm to install and run the DEMO simply.
* npm i goldvideo-player
```
see more [https://github.com/goldvideo/example](https://github.com/goldvideo/example)

# Install and build `demuxer` from source code. [optional]

you can download demuxer library source from github or install from npm(https://www.npmjs.com/package/demuxer)
```shell
* cd goldvideo
* git clone https://github.com/goldvideo/demuxer.git
* cd demuxer
* npm install
# build the module, you can see the pageage.json of demuxer
* npm install --global rollup
# build demuxer module by rollup
* rollup -c ./rollup.config.js --environment BUILD_MODE:production
* cd h265player
# install demuxer from local
* npm install ../demuxer
```

# Compile `WASM` module from source. [optional]

[decoder_wasm](https://github.com/goldvideo/decoder_wasm) has been compiled and copied to dist/lib/ before. You can compile it and replace the files(libffmpeg.js, libffmpeg.wasm).
```shell
* cd goldvideo ROOT
* git clone http://github.com/goldvideo/decoder_wasm.git
* cd decoder_wasm
```
compiling step detail to see [README](https://github.com/goldvideo/decoder_wasm/blob/master/README.md) of wasm module.

## Main Architecture
![](./docs/h265player-Architecture.png)
The player is divided into four parts of UI: Loader, Data processing, Data rendering and 3 threads. The threads One is the main thread, including interface control, download control, data flow control, audio and video control and other functions; data loading thread to complete requests for metadata and data fragments; data processing thread to complete data decapsulation and decoding.
- UI: The player have two parts that contains screen and controlbar. The screen includes video images, popup, posters, etc. And the controlbar includes components such as progress bar, play button, and volume control.
- Loader: responsible for loading and parsing of media data, currently only supports HLS protocol. The data request through by the `web worker`. After the loading is completed, the requested ts data is stored according to the set cache size, and the loading is stopped when the cache upper limit is reached. After the decoder obtains ts from the ts data queue, HlS Loader will release the requested ts, continue to load the next ts, and stop loading after reaching the maximum cache limit
- Data processing: mainly including data demux and H265 decoding. Demux is realized by demuxe.js module, H265 decoding worked by the `wasm` software solution generated by `ffmpeg` packaging, and the CPU usage rate is high.
- Data rendering: including video rendering and audio rendering. Video rendering uses `ImagePlayer` to render the decoded `yuv` data directly to the canvas. Audio uses `AudioPlayer` to decode the `AAC` data for audio playback. Finally, audio and video synchronization is achieved through `pts`. The synchronization strategy uses audio as a reference to determine the difference between the current video `pts` and the get audio `pts` to adjust the video display time to achieve audio and video synchronization.

## Progress
The process of figure:
<div align="center">
<img src="./docs/simple-flowchart.png" width="450" align="center" />
</div>

## Decode progress：
![](./docs/H265player-flowchart.png)

## Demuxer
Through `demux` module to achieve demux of media data, so as to obtain independent video (H265) data and audio (AAC) data. For details, please refer to [demuxer](https://github.com/goldvideo/demuxer)

## Decoder
The soft decoding of H265 data is realized through ffmpeg. If you want to invoke `ffmpeg` in the browser, you need to compile `ffmpeg` into `wasm`.  For the specific process of compiling `ffmpeg` into `wasm`, please refer to [decoder_wasm](https://github.com/goldvideo/ decoder_wasm)

## ImagePlayer
![](./docs/ImagePlayer.png)
Through [yuv-canvas](https://github.com/brion/yuv-canvas) to realize YUV data rendering, there will be a queue in `ImagePlayer` to store YUV data and calculate the length of time of the current yuv data, which is greater than or equals to the value of `readybufferLength` , It will trigger the `ImagePlayerReady` event. When the audio and video players are in the ready state, the H265 player triggers the `dataReady` event and starts calling the play method for video playback.

## AudioPlayer
![Audio Player](./docs/audioPlayer.png "Base on Web Audio API的Audio Player")

### Web Audio API
The implementation of Audio Player is based on Web Audio API, including decoding of AAC audio stream and playback of PCM data.　　
- Decoding: The Audio Player module receives the AAC data streaming  from the `demuxer` module,  and decodes it to being played data of PCM through the AudioCode's  decodeAudioData API.
- Audio Node: Audio Node  is the audio data `processor` in the Web Audio API. The Web Audio API serially processes the audio data through different `processors` and finally plays it by the speaker (audioContext.destination).
    - ScriptProcessorNode：The source node of Audio.Web Audio API provider more audio node, such as AudioBufferSourceNode, MediaElementAudioSourceNode etc. Considering speed playback, we used ScriptProcessorNode, request audio data by the `onaudioprocess` callback function.
    - GainNode：Node of audio volume controlling
    
### Adjust speed
The Audio Context provides the `playbackRate` attribute to achieve function of multiple speed, and while the video is played at speed, the tone of the audio is also increased/decreased synchronously.

For achieve speed changing and without modifying tone. We using the audio processing library 
`[SoundTouchJS]`(https://github.com/cutterbl/SoundTouchJS), the library will give the data of processed to `ScriptProcessorNode`.

# Quick start
## Import the js,css files
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../dist/goldplay-h265.css">
<script src="../dist/goldplay-h265-sdk.js"></script>
<style>
    .play-container{
        width: 800px;
        height: 500px;
    }
</style>
```

## Create a container for player
```html
<div class="play-container"></div>
```

## create a new `GoldPlay` instance and give some parameters
```javascript
// defined the container
let el = doc.querySelector('.play-container')
// set parameters for Player
let options = {
    // playlist address
    sourceURL: 'http://localhost:8000/h265player/data/video2/playlist.m3u8',
    type: 'HLS'
    // wasm address
    libPath: 'http://localhost:8000/h265player/dist/lib',
}
let player = new GoldPlay(el, options}
```
